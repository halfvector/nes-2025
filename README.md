# Nintendo Emulator in Rust

Learn Rust by building an NES emulator ‚Äî the third generation of a long-running experiment in recreating the same console across different languages, goals, and phases of life.

## üß¨ Emulator Generations

1. **2007 in C++98**: The impulse build.  
   It started during finals week. I had a sudden urge to see Mario jump on screen ‚Äî more than I wanted to study. I stayed up til 4am for multiple nights, skipped at least one final, and hacked together enough CPU, GPU, APU, and controller logic to play some *Super Mario Bros.*  
   **Goal**: *Just make it work.* A scrappy, late-night systems adventure. Pure unadulterated dopamine.

2. **2015 in C++14**: The performance pass.  
   This version focused on speed and compatibility. I experimented with static vs dynamic polymorphism, optimized virtual dispatch and CPU cache layout, and implemented multiple memory mappers.  
   Supporting more games also meant deeper dives into the NES‚Äôs quirks ‚Äî from complex PPU rendering tricks to more advanced APU audio behavior.  
   Getting *Mega Man* and *Zelda* running was especially fun.  
   **Goal**: *Make it fast. Support more games. Explore hardware quirks.* Pure OCD.

3. **2025 in Rust**: The teaching edition.  
   This version is all about learning a new language. It‚Äôs a Rust codebase with a focus on readability, commentary, and syntax explanation optimized for developers coming from C or Go.  
   **Goal**: *Make it educational. Learn Rust with AI.*

## üçÑ Super Mario Bros: The NES "Hello, World"

The first test case is *Super Mario Bros.*  

It's a simple ROM and it's iconic, touching every sub-system: CPU, PPU, APU, input, memory mapping.  

The goal is to get the **first level** of gameplay running. If Mario walks and jumps, makes that jump and brick hit sounds, the emulator has a working vertical slice, the **walking skeleton**.

Yes, there are official test ROMs for hardware accuracy and testing, *but Mario is more fun.*

## üìö What This Is

- A readable, well-commented emulator that teaches Rust in context  
- Prioritizes clarity over speed or completeness  
- Built with AI tools (Windsurf + LLMs) to explore new ways of learning and pair-programming

## üß≠ Who This Is For

- Rust learners from C/Python/Go  
- Emulator hobbyists  
- Code-readers and tinkerers

## üéØ Project Goals

- Build a working core  
- Use Mario as a first test  
- Explain Rust clearly  
- Skip premature optimization  
- Keep it fun
